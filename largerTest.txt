The Iron Oath of Eldermoor

In the year of the Withering Harvest, the kingdom of Eldermoor stood on the edge of ruin. The fields lay fallow, and the wind carried whispers of something ancient stirring beneath the hills. Among the desolate northern villages, folk told tales of the Iron Oath, a pact forged in blood between kings and monsters, long buried in time.

At the heart of this tale rode Sir Corwin of Thornhelm, a fallen knight exiled for disobeying a command he deemed unjust. A man of tarnished honor but unyielding heart, Corwin wandered the old roads with nothing but his rusted sword and a silver token from his sister (the last token of family he had).

One dusk, as the sun bled red across the sky, Corwin arrived at a hamlet called Virestead. Its well was dry, its chapel burned, and its people hollow-eyed and silent. At the inn, the barkeep whispered of disappearances, of villagers vanishing into the night and returning days later, changed. They spoke no words, feared the sun, and stared too long into the fire.

Guided by guilt more than duty, Corwin rode toward the forest where the disappearances began. There, in the grove of whispering ash trees, he found the ruins of an altar, carved with runes older than the kingdom itself. As he knelt to examine the markings, the earth shuddered and a voice like cracked stone rose from below:

"The oath is broken. The price must be paid."

From the shadows emerged a figure, cloaked in furs, antlers crowning her brow, eyes pale as frost. She was the Warden of the Deep Pact, an ancient guardian bound to the Iron Oath. She spoke of Eldermoor's first king, who bargained with the forest spirits for power and promised them a soul every century. The last offering had not come.

"The king is long dead," Corwin said.
"The crown remains," she answered.

To lift the curse, Corwin had to journey to the ruins of Eldenfort, where the pact was sealed. There, he faced the remnants of that first king, a corpse-puppet of vengeance called the Oathwraith. With blade and fire, and a prayer to a god he no longer trusted, Corwin struck the creature down.

But victory bore a cost. To seal the pact and end the curse, a soul had to be freely given. Without hesitation, Corwin pressed his hand to the altar and whispered his sister's name, bidding her a final farewell.

The earth swallowed him whole. The trees grew silent. And peace, at long last, returned to Eldermoor.

Each spring now, the villagers leave a silver token by the altar, not in fear, but in honor.

Of the knight who kept an oath not his own.
