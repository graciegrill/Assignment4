the-iron-oath-of-eldermoor!

in-the-year-of-the-withering-harvest.-the-kingdom-of-eldermoor-stood-on-the-edge-of-ruin.-the-fields-lay-fallow.-and-the-wind-carried-whispers-of-something-ancient-stirring-beneath-the-hills.-among-the-desolate-northern-villages.-folk-told-tales-of-the-iron-oath.-a-pact-forged-in-blood-between-kings-and-monsters.-long-buried-in-time.!

at-the-heart-of-this-tale-rode-sir-corwin-of-thornhelm.-a-fallen-knight-exiled-for-disobeying-a-command-he-deemed-unjust.-a-man-of-tarnished-honor-but-unyielding-heart.-corwin-wandered-the-old-roads-with-nothing-but-his-rusted-sword-and-a-silver-token-from-his-sister-the-last-token-of-family-he-had.!

one-dusk.-as-the-sun-bled-red-across-the-sky.-corwin-arrived-at-a-hamlet-called-virestead.-its-well-was-dry.-its-chapel-burned.-and-its-people-hollow-eyed-and-silent.-at-the-inn.-the-barkeep-whispered-of-disappearances.-of-villagers-vanishing-into-the-night-and-returning-days-later.-changed.-they-spoke-no-words.-feared-the-sun.-and-stared-too-long-into-the-fire.!

guided-by-guilt-more-than-duty.-corwin-rode-toward-the-forest-where-the-disappearances-began.-there.-in-the-grove-of-whispering-ash-trees.-he-found-the-ruins-of-an-altar.-carved-with-runes-older-than-the-kingdom-itself.-as-he-knelt-to-examine-the-markings.-the-earth-shuddered-and-a-voice-like-cracked-stone-rose-from-below.!

the-oath-is-broken.-the-price-must-be-paid.!

from-the-shadows-emerged-a-figure.-cloaked-in-furs.-antlers-crowning-her-brow.-eyes-pale-as-frost.-she-was-the-warden-of-the-deep-pact.-an-ancient-guardian-bound-to-the-iron-oath.-she-spoke-of-eldermoor's-first-king.-who-bargained-with-the-forest-spirits-for-power-and-promised-them-a-soul-every-century.-the-last-offering-had-not-come.!

the-king-is-long-dead-corwin-said.!
the-crown-remains-she-answered.!

to-lift-the-curse.-corwin-had-to-journey-to-the-ruins-of-eldenfort.-where-the-pact-was-sealed.-there.-he-faced-the-remnants-of-that-first-king.-a-corpse-puppet-of-vengeance-called-the-oathwraith.-with-blade-and-fire.-and-a-prayer-to-a-god-he-no-longer-trusted.-corwin-struck-the-creature-down.!

but-victory-bore-a-cost.-to-seal-the-pact-and-end-the-curse.-a-soul-had-to-be-freely-given.-without-hesitation.-corwin-pressed-his-hand-to-the-altar-and-whispered-his-sister's-name.-bidding-her-a-final-farewell.!

the-earth-swallowed-him-whole.-the-trees-grew-silent.-and-peace.-at-long-last.-returned-to-eldermoor.!

each-spring-now.-the-villagers-leave-a-silver-token-by-the-altar.-not-in-fear.-but-in-honor.!
